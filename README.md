PayUp

PayUp is an expense tracking and managing mobile application.
An individual can set up an account either through email, or using their Google sign in, and make their own profile, containing personal information and an optional profile picture. The app keeps track of the money spent and creates monthly reports which will be represented through graphs. Users can set monthly limits and get notifications if the expenditure for the month exceeds the limit. 
The main purpose of Pay Up is to send notes of transactions to other friends/ users indicating amounts that need to be paid or that the user needs to pay, and the reason. This helps track of who owes whom and how much.
Using PayUp, users can split various bills ( household bills, pending amount, food bills) with their friends. A reminder/ notification will be sent to those who havenâ€™t paid, each time a new transaction is added.
